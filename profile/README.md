# MATISSE-Consortium
This organisation contains repositories to make it easiert to work with the MATISSE/VLTI-instrument in various aspects.
For an in-depth explanation of the various functionality see the different repositories' `README.md`/description.

The MATISSE-consortium organisation is supplementary to and an extension of the [mat-tools](https://gitlab.oca.eu/MATISSE/tools/-/tree/master) GitLab-repository,
which mainly takes care of data reduction ([`matadrs`](https://github.com/Matisse-Consortium/matadrs) is partially based on this).

The MATISSE-Consortium is also working on a model-fitting tool [`oimodeler`](https://github.com/oimodeler/oimodeler), which is meant for 
instrument-independent interferometric model-fitting.

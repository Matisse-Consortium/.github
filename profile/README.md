# MATISSE-Consortium
This organisation contains repositories to make it easiert to work with the MATISSE/VLTI-instrument in various aspects.
For an in-depth explanation of the various functionality see the different repositories' `README.md`/description.

The MATISSE-Consortium itself is also working on a model-fitting tool called [`oimodeler`](https://github.com/oimodeler/oimodeler), which is meant for 
instrument-independent interferometric model-fitting.

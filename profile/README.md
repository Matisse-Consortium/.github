# MATISSE-Consortium
This organisation contains repositories to make it easier to work with the VLTI/MATISSE instrument in various aspects.
For an in-depth explanation of the various functionality see the different repositories' `README.md`/description.

For a selection of helpful tools see the [`tools`](https://github.com/Matisse-Consortium/tools) repository. This also includes a [wiki](https://github.com/Matisse-Consortium/tools/wiki) showcasing the use of the MATISSE data reduction software (DRS) and more guides.

The MATISSE-Consortium itself is also working on a model-fitting tool called [`oimodeler`](https://github.com/oimodeler/oimodeler), which is designed for 
instrument-independent interferometric model-fitting.
